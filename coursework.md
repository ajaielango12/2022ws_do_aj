### Holocracy 

Holacracy is an organisational structure that incorporates decentralised management where a management comprises of various units that work autonomously to achieve a goal. 

A Dig Dip will show you that holacracy in structure is similar to some function which are autonomous within  organs which in turn functions autonomous with the body.Its similar to 
Cells Function within in an organ and In turn Organ Functions Within Body This biologic relevance proofs that when a organ could work independently its same that applies to humans.

Companies Have To Survive in a extremely dynamic and complex environment which in turn means companies have to be dynamic in nature 

The self-organization is concentrated on a single, overarching objective that frequently ignores everything related to the organization's welfare (such as profit). The organization hereby acknowledges its role within a greater whole and the associated responsibilities.

Distributed authority has taken the role of the traditional (power) hierarchy. Organizational parts are grouped together and arranged in a purpose hierarchy that naturally progresses from "structure follows function" to "structure follows purpose."
Each organizational unit is independent and endowed with the necessary authority. Anything that is not expressly banned is allowed - up until other agreements are formed concerning. Making Requests and Approvals Thing From The Past .

The company is flexible, constantly changing, and growing quickly. Top-down control and prediction are replaced by attention and experimentation. The organization gradually becomes more "fit for purpose" in a world where change and disruption are the norm.

Dynamic management requires transparency. As far as possible, information and criticism are made available for free so that the organization can develop and grow.

## How to practice Holacracy


Playing the game helps you become more familiar with holacracy. Consult an expert for knowledgeable direction. A coach is familiar with the rules and frameworks. Football, for example, cannot be learned from a book. Holacracy operates in a similar manner.
Just enough of the current organizational structure and agreements will be described in an initial structure with independent roles and circles. After that, we'll start playing "the game." Based on tensions, the organization (and consequently the circles and responsibilities) continuously changes. The gap between a situation's current state and its potential state is known as a tension. In this approach, the organization begins to adjust gradually.



## What type of transformation would Holacracy introduce into your company?: 

The most striking contrasts between a holacratic organization and a standard hierarchical structure are four of them.

From roles to functions, no more functions
From delegated to diffused authority, there is no longer a boss.
Agile: rapid, incremental evolution rather than large reorganizations
Responsibility clarification: explicit and transparent norms rather than politics based on implicit expectations

## How does holacracy apply in project management?:

- Enables fast and High Quality Project Delivery 

- Empowers Project Staff

- Eliminate Unnecessary Meetings To Save Time
