# Holacracy

## Holacracy 


The new management system that made headline news when Zappos asked that all its employees follow the system or take a pay to resign in 14% of the employees. The  holacracy structure resembles how nature organizes systems like the human body, where cells function autonomously within organs, which in turn function autonomously within the body. 


The impetus behind Holacracy, the main idea behind this new system, is that today's companies must survive in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment that requires an equally dynamic organizational structure to properly address new challenges and opportunities. 
The solution germinated from the observation that humans have a unique ability to sense tension within an organization, which is defined as recognizing the gap of what currently exists and what could be the current reality and the sense potential. 


Holacracy is like your company's operating system. By allowing all employees (instead of just management) the ability to innovate, make changes, and have a voice, it is a specified set of rules and processes, checks and balances, and guidelines that a company may utilize to aid in becoming self-managed and self-organized.


## Why should you care? 


"Holacracy is a system that aims to make companies evolutionary by capitalizing on this unique ability that we have." (“Holacracy: A Management System Based on Self-Organization”) By doing away with the concept of manager, it effectively breaks down communication and collaboration barriers formed by traditional siloed pyramid organization structures. Managers like the new system because they don't have to spend their entire day solving everyone's problems. And employees like it because they feel truly empowered to act on tensions, problems, and opportunities that they recognize. 


Rethinking the corporate organization Structure instead of thinking of a company as a pyramid of people in different departments and with different authorities, think of it as a set of nested circles that consist of different roles, not people. 


For example, a company may have a production. A marketing and a finance role, and a person can fill more than one role. The founder may fill the marketing and finance roles in a start-up, while an employee fills the production role. 


All these roles live within a circle which is simply a group of roles. As a company evolved and roles become too complex, they can break into sub circles. In the previous example, the marketing role can later evolve into a marketing circle that encompasses the roles of client communications, advertising, and social media. 


Innovation to Empower Employees one of the key innovations of Holocaust is that the person who fills a role is empowered to execute an assignment the best way he or she sees fit. There's no manager to override that decision, and no one has such authority, not even the CEO. 
In this sense, democracy creates a very empowering environment where authority is truly distributed. 


For example, if the person filling the marketing role in an organization wants to create a website for the company, he is free to do so without asking anyone's permission. The only limitation is from any restrictions set in governance.


For example, there could be a rule regarding the use of the company's logo that he needs to adhere to. Now, let's say that the person filling the event’s organizer role notices that the information on the company's LinkedIn page is not updated frequently enough with the company's events information. 


If she wants to expect the marketing role will do that regularly, then she must propose adding a new accountability to the marketing role during a governance meeting. At an upcoming governance meeting, the person in the event’s organizer role presents that proposal. 


After a structured process involving some clarification and reactions, the meeting moved on to the Objections round, where the marketing person says he can't post about events because he doesn't have the clear information on when they're scheduled. 


They amend the proposal to also make the event’s organizer role accountable for publishing a calendar of events. Once there are no more objections. The proposal gets adopted. What does it all mean? 


The holacracy playbook is new and feels complex. It starts by separating people from functions as signs of activities to specific roles, dynamically adjusting roles as companies and their environments evolve, and making sure that roles have great clarity. 


The most striking contrasts between a Holarctic organization and a standard hierarchical structure are four of them.
### The Change 
•	From roles to functions, no more functions
•	From delegated to diffused authority, there is no longer a boss.
•	Agile: rapid, incremental evolution rather than large reorganizations
•	Responsibility clarification: explicit and transparent norms rather than politics based on implicit expectations


For Whom It May Suit:
•	You are looking to promote autonomy and innovation.
•	You want to change the way people work and get more out of them.
•	You need better decision-making and execution speed.
•	You have ambitious goals but lack the resources necessary to achieve them.
•	You want to bring everyone's talents and ideas to life
 
Project Management and Holacracy: 


- Enables fast and High-Quality Project Delivery by allowing contributors to work on their own and contribute and finish their task eliminating the need for dependencies


- Empowers Project Staff, the project manager has a purpose not to delegate or command authority but to influence and motivate them. Since it revolves around self-management the employees are usually responsible of their own work and they decided for themselves on what’s right. 


- Eliminate Unnecessary Meetings to Save Time, holacracy places high value on peoples time and resources so it eliminates unnecessary meetings by eliminating approvals and what to do meetings either they are focused on strategy, growth and so on.


As there are many positives attached to holacracy there are few criticisms as well associated with which is common for any system to be adapted. It is up to the decision makes to select for the positives leave the negatives and weigh the positives and negatives to decide on the way forward.


But this is just the beginning. Holacracy is a very different management system that requires you to rethink your organization from the ground up. It may feel awkward, foreign, and uncomfortable at first, but it may be the only path to instead all evolution within your company. Holacracy might not just be a way to manage your organization more effectively but would be one of the few ways your company could just run autonomously while you focus your attention on growing the company way forward.
